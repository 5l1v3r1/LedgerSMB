# LedgerSMB aims to comply with the Perl::Critic policies recommended
# by by CERT. See:
# https://gist.github.com/briandfoy/4525877
# https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/perl/SEI+CERT+Perl+Coding+Standard
#
# Currently our code violates some of the recommended policies, so tests
# are being added to this list as violations are fixed.

# lsmb_new


# The CERT recommended policies yet to be applied are listed below. Some
# of these are explicitly excluded below, as they would otherwise be
# applied by the -severity option in use.

# lsmb_wip ( lsmb_new_wip, lsmb_old_wip)

# The following CERT recommended policies will not be enforced:
#
#    ErrorHandling::RequireCarping
#      As per ledgerSMB coding guidelines, calling "die" is the preferred
#      way to signal an error. We can't stop die()ing, because that's how
#      our error handling is implemented.  See:
#      https://ledgersmb.org/community-guide/community-guide/development/coding-guidelines/perl-coding-guidelines
#      https://matrix.to/#/!qyoLumPqusaXqFJNyK:matrix.org/$1492804519389522uYnup:matrix.org
#
#    Subroutines::ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines
#      This policy doesn't recognise when private subroutines are legitimately
#      used as builder functions for Moose properties, which is a common
#      pattern employed in LedgerSMB code. Neither does it recognise when
#      private methods are used to compose roles in other files.

# lsmb_reject

# LedgerSMB enforces some other Perl::Critic policies
#
#  lsmb_new


# LedgerSMB explicitly excludes some policies which we currently violate
# and which would be applied automatically by the -severity option in use.
# As violations are fixed, we can gradually remove these exclusions.
