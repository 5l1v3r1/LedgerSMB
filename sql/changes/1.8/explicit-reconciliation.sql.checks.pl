The migration procedure found un-approved reconciliations in your database.

After upgrading, the procedure to determine reconcilable lines will be
different from the procedure used before the upgrade. Because of this
difference in treatment, it's not possible to migrate unapproved
reconcilitiations (*approved* reconciliations __will__ be migrated).

Please delete the unapproved reconciliations listed in the table below
by clicking the 'Delete Unapproved Reconciliations' button.
